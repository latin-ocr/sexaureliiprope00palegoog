, or 'though an independent line of transcription‚ (which
isan extremely improbable contingency,) they would
prove 01 no service whatever. Jacob, who has examined
the question with care and critical judgment, gives his
opinion in these words: ‘Ita omnino sentio, nihil boni

The person mentioned 10 this extract, Francesoo Pucci,
corrected the text 01 Propertius by MS. alterations made
in 0 copy 01 the edition of 1481‚†. by the aid 01 0 valuable
codex belonging to Bernardino Valla.‡ This was done in
15023 but it is thought that the same MS. had been care-
lessly inspected by some 01 the earlier editore, especially
Beroaldus (1487). Wherever Pucci professes 10 have
restored the text from this MS, he has altered the words
01 the printed copy3 while such as were merely conjec-
tural readings he has recorded in the margin. 11010110-
nately, grave suspicion attaches to some 01 his verbal
alterations as having no higher authority than his marginal
suggestions. Where the particular copy corrected by
Pucci newis, it does not appear ; but the extracts were
faithfully copied for Kuinoel and¹ saecat and had been
used by many editors before them. ⁵
