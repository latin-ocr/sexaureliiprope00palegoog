LIBER IV.

XXI.

Magnum iter ad doctas proficisci cogor Athenas,
Ut me longa gravi solvat amore via.

Crescit enim assidue spectando cura puellae:
lpse alimenta sibi maxima praebet amor.

Possit: at ex omni me premit ipse deus.

Vix tamen aut semel admittit, cum saepe negavit;
Seu venit, extremo dormit amica toro.
