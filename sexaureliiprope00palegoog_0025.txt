XX Falernos.

is the first edition which, rejecting the many useless alter·
ations of the text that had found a place in every one
since the time of Scaliger, recalled the genuine readings
on the authority of the best MSS. Itis a clever, without
being a satisfactory book. The editor seems scarcely to
have possessed that· taste and poetical judgment which
perhaps can only be gained in the school of elegiac· com·
position. Unable to emancipato himself entirely from the
opinions of his predecessors about the corrupt state of the

text* he has introduced not a few corrections and trans· .

positions of his own, which can rarely be called successful.
. An excellent Latin scholar, he has copiously illustrated by
parallel passages the less common constructions of the

wholly those which bore evidences of late interpolation, and
correctly pointing out such as were of the highest authority.

The critical notes at the end of the volume are brief, but

exhibit great shrewdness, judgment, and knowledge of the ’
idioms of the author. His fault is, a tendency to follow -
Lachmann’s z'pse dicit too reverentially, combined with an
error in the other extreme, reluctance to depart from MS.
readings even where they are clearly untenable. His text
is founded entirely on the Naples and Groningen MSS,
the ed. Rheg. of 1481, and the cacerpto of Pucci.
