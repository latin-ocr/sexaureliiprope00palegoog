1110 potest nullo miseram me linquere facte,
AEqualem nulla dicere habere domo.

Gaudet me vacuo solam tabescere lecto:
Si placet, insultet, Lygdame, morte mea.

Non me moribus illa, sed herbis improba vicit: 25

Et lecta exectis anguibus ossa trahunt,

Et strigis inventae per busta jacentia plumae,
Cinctaque funesto lanea vitta viro. 30
