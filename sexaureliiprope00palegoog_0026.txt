Pannacn. xxi

(5.) Guil. Hertzberg, Halia, 1843-4. (4 vols. 8vo.)
This is by much the best aud most complete edition that
has appeared. Far superior in learning 10 his predecessore,
and furnished with a complete collation of all the good
MSS, he has given an excellent and accurate text, followed
by a full and somcwhat lengthy commentary (0110111500

a word, and that an attempt to reduce all spelling to
uniformity is to do that for an ancient writer which he did
not do for himself. In the Augustan age, as inscriptions
