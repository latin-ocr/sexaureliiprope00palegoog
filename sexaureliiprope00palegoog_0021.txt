of copies, unfortunately, that the earliest printed editions†
were chiefly obtained.

Lachmann enumeratos seven MSS. which he considers
more or less authentic; and Hertzberg has given the
readings of that number in his recent edition. But there
are in fact only two, or at most three, which can claim to
be wholly or nearly free from conjectural interpolations.
The oldest is the Naples MS, already mentioned, of the
thirteenth century ε but the best is generally considered to
be the Codex Groninganus, (at Groningen, in Holland,)
though its readings, which sometimes differ from all
others, are oocasionally suspicious. The third is the
Hamburg MS, of which Hertzberg has given for the first
time a complete and accurate collation. It isnot earlier

than the fifteenth century, but, though full of errors and
mis-spelt names, is apparently derived from a good source, ·
and has not been tempered with by the transcriber.‡

It is not improbable that other MSS. beside those
hitherto examined may still exist, even in this country.§
