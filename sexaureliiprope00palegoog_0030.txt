PREFACR “ XXV

along'with the times, and keep up with them too. A
Latin speech, a concio 'ad curam, or a disputation in the
divinity schools, can seldom'obtain an audience. They
are regarded as mere forms and obsolete practices: nor
does it seem possible efficiently to revive them. They
are remnants of what were essentially charel timec But
it is celtain that the ecclesiastical clement can be no

change of feeling which undoubtedly exists on this im·

classical learning has been used to take in it. It is almost

honours which in 'the last generation were heaped upon
