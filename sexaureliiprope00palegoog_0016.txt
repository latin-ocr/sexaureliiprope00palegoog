rude and licentious composer, and to consider the polished
but monotonous Ovidis-n distich as the standard of excel-
lence. Our best writers of Latin elegy have generally
preferred a certain neatness and prettiness, a harmony and
a fine finish, toa nervous and pointed expression. Thus
there is much that is taking, but little that is statiny, in
modern compositions. The use of words of four or five
syllables at¹ the end of the pentameter is held to be a
licence. Propertius on the contrary thought it an im·
portant clement of beauty: and the Greeks, no mean judges
of the τὸ καλὸν, evidently thought so too. It may be
questioned if a rule arbitrarily but rigidly drawn should
not be relaxed, and the proscription confined to words of
three syllables. Take the opening lines of the first book
as an illustration: ·

Cynthia prima suis miserum me oepit ocellis,
Contentum nullis ante cupidinibus.

Tum mihi constantis dejecit lumina fastus,
llt caput impositis pressit Amor pedibus,

Donec me docuit castas odisse puellas
Improbns, et nullo vivere consilio.

Here the fourth verse alone, metrically considered, is not
pleasing. But let the following passage* be examined
with attention, and it cannot fail to strike the reader of
taste and judgment as singularly beautiful :—

Ille sub extrema pendens secluditur ala
ut volucres ramo submovet insidias.
J am Pandioniae cessat genus Orithyiae:
Ah dolor! ibat Hylas, ibat Hamadryasin.
Hic erat Arganthi Pege sub vertice montis,
Grata domus Nymphis humida Thyniasin:
