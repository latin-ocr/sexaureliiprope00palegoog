LIBER IV.

Omphale in tantum formae processit honorem,
Lydia Gygaeo tincta puella lacu,
Ut, qui pacato statuisset in orbe columnas,
Tam dura traheret mollia pensa manu. 20

Ut solidum cocto tolleret aggere opus,
Et duo in adversum missi per moenia currus,
Ne possent tacto stringere ab axe latus.
Duxit et Euphratem medium, qua condidit arces, 25
lussit et imperio surgere Bactra caput.
