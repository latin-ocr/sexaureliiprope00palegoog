Propertius, however, though a slave, aud a servile oue,

to the fashion of his age, was a true Roman at heart. His
nationul syruputhies and antipathies are osten strongly and
fearlessly expressed. So far as he is artificinl, he issar
less pleasing than when he lays asido the tinsel of Greek
learning, and gives vent to his naturally fine feelings in
simple and touching and truly native strains.† Partly
from this affectation of learning, partly, perhaps, from the
same cause which imparts so much difficulty to the
writings of Tacitus, the desire to avoid common-place
expressions, but still more from a genius which was impa-
tient of restraint, the poems of Propertius are often very
obscure. In this respect he is the AEsohylus of the Roman
Muse; a writer who cannot be thoroughly understood
without attentive study of his peculiar style and ¹construc-
tions. Oi him almost as truly as of Persius it might have
been said, si noa vis intelligimus debes lapi. A young poet
and a hasty composer, often writing under the excitement
of jealousy and disappointment, he is frequently abrupt
and impassioned in his appeals. The sudden and start-
ling transitions, occasionally amounting to positive inco-
herenoes, greatly perplex the reader who is not prepared
to meet with them. But beside the difficulty os the
Latinity‚ the text, at least till of late years, has been left
in a very unsatisfactory state. Though no one at the pre·
