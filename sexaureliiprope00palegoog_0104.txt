LIBER 11,

Non hic herba valet, non hic nocturna Cytaeis,
Non Perimedeae gramina cocta manus.
Quippe uhi nec causas uec apertos cernimus ictus,
Unde tamen veniant tot mala, oseca via est. ιο
Non eget hic medicis, non lectis mullibus aeger;
Huic nullum coeli tempus et aura nocet.
Ambulat, et subito mirantur funus amici:
Sic est incautum, quicquid habetur amor.
Nam cui non ego sum fallaci praemia vati? 15
Quae mea non decies somnia versat anus?
Hostis si quis erit nobis, amet ille puellas ;
Gaudeat in puer0, si quis amicus erit.
