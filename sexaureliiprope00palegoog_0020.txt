PREFAGE. XV

sent day gives any credit to an idle tale of the fifteenth
century, that the only existing MS. of our poet had been
found in owine-cellar* greatly damaged by age and damp,
it is incredible what influence it formerly exercised on the
critical efforts of tho editors. Assuming that every known
MS. had been transcribed from this one scarcely legible
copy, they took it for granted that nothing but conjectural
emendation could restore the text to an integrity which in
fact it had never lost. Hence Scaliger and his followers,
of whom Kuinoel was the last representative, introduced
the most reckless, improbable, and destructive alterations
and transpositions. They mistook eccentricities of style
for errors of the copyists‚ and laboured to reduce every
rough and disjointed passage to an arbitrary standard of
elegance. An examination of the now carefully collected
readings of the best MSS. will shew‚ that though Proper·
tius has suffered somewhat from the long neglect into
which his writings had fallent the corruption of his text
had been greatly overrated. There are very few passages
which are certainly and hopelessly faulty. The loss, such
as it is, must be considered irreparable, since all the copies
now known are evidently derived from one archetypus,‡
which was in all probability corrupt in these very places.
