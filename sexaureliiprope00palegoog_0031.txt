xxvi PREFAOE.

classical scholars are not likely to be bestowed even on a
Porson or aBentley in these times. The fact is no longer

to be concealed, that classical learning is not, in this
country, prosecuted as it once was ; and there seems very ,
little hope of the lost ground being regained. It is pro·

bable indeed that but for the influenoe of the Germano,

who still devote themselves to the prosound investigation of
the-dead languages with unabated ardour and immense

success, there would be a much more rapid decline of
scholarship amongst ourselves. The great influx of their

books, and a sort of honourable rivshy'in our literati not

to be behind them, tend to keep up a certain standard-

and I do not say it is a low one-amongst us. What we

have now to fear is, the usual results of a reaction,-·

excess on the other side. Utilitarian principles may be

pushed so far that classical studies will be regarded as

necessary for none but clerics, and suited to none but

those whose testes are literary, or whose profession is the

sciense of languages. This sentiment is widely prevalent

in America, and is gaining ground in this country* where,

next after Germany, classica] studies have long had their

deepest root in public estimation.

Should they however eventually become unpopular, or

neglected and disregarded as not being worth the long
years of labour they require, a great change must inevit-
ably come over our character as a literary nation. -It will
probably be discovered, when too late, that neither history,
nor poetry, nor modern European languages can be pro·
secuted with equal advantage or success· ⁴Neither fine
