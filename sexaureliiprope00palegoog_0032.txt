toste, nor ready memory, nor flueney and accuracy of
style, will be attained with the same certainty in any other
way. Eloquence will be less frequent, manners and social
habits less polished, conversational powers less brilliant, a
comprehensiones grammatical principles (and how many
consequences does this involvel) less acute. Nor is it
probable that, as a general discipline of the intellect‚ any
more efficient substitute for the classical languages will be
found. As society is now constituted, a knowledge of
Latin at least may be pronounced absolutely indispensable

for a well-educated man· It is the base of most European Ἴ

languages, and the key to the literature of all. It has never
been a dead language, in the sense that Greek hasbeen,
in the West· It is a fired language only because its
standard is an unchangeable literature of great antiquity.
With a very large portion of the educated world it con·
tinues to be the medium through which the products of
genius become the common property of all nations. Itis
therefore obvious that, whatever views may be entertained
on the intrinsic merits and value of Roman literature, the
Latin language could not be banished from our schools
without very momentous results. And, as it is certain
that the language itself cannot be well and fully learned
apart from the study of the best Latin authors, l may
venture to hope that even Propertius with all his moral
defects and blemishes, will be judged to have his proper
place in the scheme of classical education.
