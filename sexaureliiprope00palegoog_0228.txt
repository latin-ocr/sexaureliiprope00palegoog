11111 w. 195

Odi ege, quum numquam pungunt suspiria somnos.
Semper in irata pallidus esse velim.

Dulcior ignis erat Paridi, cum Graia per arma ’
Tyndaridi poterat gaudia ferre suae. 30

Dum vincunt Danai, dum restat barbarus Hector,
Ille Helenae in gremio maxima bella gerit.

Aut tecum, aut pro te mihi cum rivalibus arma
Semper erunt: in te pax mihi nulla placet.

Gaude, quod nulla est aeque formosa3 doleres, 35
Si qua foret3 nunc sis jure superba licet.

At tibi, qui nostro tendisti retia lecto,
Sit socer aetemum, nec sine matre domus!
