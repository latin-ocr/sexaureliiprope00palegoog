Extrema, mea luX, cum potus nocte vagarer,
Nec me servorum duceret ulla manus,
Obvia nescio quot pueri mihi turba minuta
Venerat 3-hos vetuit me numerare timor,-
Quorum alii faculae, alii retinere sagittae, 5

Arripite hunc, inquit, nam bene nostis eum ;

Dixit, et in collo jam mihi nodus erat. 10
Hic alter jubet in medium propellere, at alter:
Intereat, qui nos non putat esse deos!
Haec te non meritum totas expectat in horae ;
At tu nescio quas quaeris, inepte, force.
