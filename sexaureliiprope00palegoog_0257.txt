Digne Jovis natos qui tueare senex,
Tu reddis pueris matrem, puerique trahendam
Vinxerunt Dircen sub trucis ora bovis.
Antiope, cognosce d ovem: tibi gloria Dirce
Ducitur, in multis mortem habitura loeis. 40
Prata cruentantur Zetho, victorque canebat
Paeana Amphion rupe, Aracynthe, tua.
At tu non meritam parcas vexare Lycinnam ;
Nescit vestra ruens ira referre pedem. “
Fabula nulla tuas de nobis ¹concitet aures: 45
Te solam et lignis funeris ustus amem.
