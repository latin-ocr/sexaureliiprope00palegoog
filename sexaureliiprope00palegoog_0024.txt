(1.) Frid. Gottlieb Barth, lapsiae, 1777. (1 101. 810.)
A good and laboriously compiled edition, with brief and
judicious, though rather superficiei, explanatory notes, and

a copious apparatas 01111001, containing the collation of
most 01 the early printed copies. The text is a mere
reprint* from the second Gottingen edition 01 1762. The
editor reserves the expression 01 1111 own opinionon dis·
puted readings for the critical notes.† Α Ρ101000 and
Introduction 01 100 peges, and an Iudex and 01011101
140 more, contain 11101111 matter, but are too long for mere
appendages. · « .
ΙῘ(2.) Christian· Theophilus Kuinoel, Lepcim· 1805. (2
1011. 810.) This edition, though perhaps the most com·
monly in use, is deserving 01 little praise. Not only is the
text interpolated with many hundreda 01 conjectural read·
ings, but the oommentary is a mere compilation, or rather,
plagiarism, from his predecessore, from whom he con·
stantly 00110111 whole· notes, word 101 word, without any
acknowledgment. It has the single merit 01 being fully
illustrative and explanatory. Kuinoel was a scholar 01
some teste, but not a profound one.‡ The second volume
contains theupparatus 01111001, and is 01 11111001 no velue
from its indiscriminate collection 01 good, bad, and in-
different. , ·‘ ,
