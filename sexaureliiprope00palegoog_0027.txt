not without its analogy in other languages. The Anglo·
Saxona rarely spelt the same word alike for three timoe
consecutively; even in English letters and documents of
two or three centuries old the same inconsistency may be
noticed in a remarkable degree3 nor are Greek inscript

Entirely assenting to the opinion of Dr. Donaldson‚†
that Latin scholarship cannot be considered in a flourish·

this work, even if it should be pronounoed but an addi·
tional evidence of the fact, will prove an inducement to
others to exart themselves, not indeed less in the cause of
Greek, but more in the caum of Roman literature· of the
two languages, the Latin is assuredly the more difficult,
as well as, for all practical pmposes, by much the more
important. In this country, the number of Greek scholare

probably &far exceeds that of those who⁴ are-equally pro·
ficient in Latin. Generally, lbelieve, it would be found,
that if a passage of Sophocles and an ode of Horace should

chance to be set in any University examination, a
better knowledge of the former than of the latter author
would be displayed. The truth is, very few can be great
in both languages. It is not therefore unreasonable'that
especial attention should be paid to one: the evil to be
deprecated is the sacrificing the more useful to the more
fascinating study. If the brilliant imagination, originality
of thought, and magnificent language of the Greeks are
more captivating, and if everything Roman seems but a
